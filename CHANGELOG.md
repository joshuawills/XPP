## TODO

- Templates
- Add in for loops 
- Moduling system
- References?

- Documentation!
    - General instructions for language features
    - Classes in the CFG
    - "->" in the CFG
    - you can have duplicate defs via a using statement
        - only consider that in the current module
        - need an import statement to access one outside of the module specifically
        - TEST THIS CASE - for name resolution in the IR
